      "Overview: Make Fashion Great Again è il frutto di un ambizioso obiettivo: riportare la moda a qualcosa di veramente grande, conferendo ad ogni capo un messaggio culturale dal sapore contemporaneo. Oggi molte persone giudicano la moda come l’espressione superficiale di una società frivola, dimenticandosi che nella storia dell’uomo gli abiti sono sempre stati un potente strumento di cambiamento. Intrisa nel tessuto sociale da milioni di anni, la moda è sopravvissuta alle guerre e ha cambiato le idee più radicate. Proprio come fece Mademoiselle Chanel, la stilista che nel ‘900 rivoluzionò il modo di vestire (e di pensare) delle donne regalando loro libertà, speranza e posti di lavoro concreti. Alleata delle voci anticonformiste, la moda ha lottato al fianco delle più significative proteste politiche, come insegna Lady Vivienne Westwood, la stilista inglese che ha portato il movimento punk dai sobborghi di Londra alle passerelle di tutto il mondo. Altro fenomeno di costume che ha segnato la visione MFGA è il ritorno dell’Hanfu, un abito della cultura cinese dalle origini millenarie. La passione per questo capo al di fuori delle ricorrenze tradizionali si deve ad un ragazzo della città di Pingliang che, mixandolo con accessori contemporanei, ha dato vita ad un vero e proprio trend. MFGA vuole essere questo: l’innovazione che arricchisce la tradizione.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In un mondo che ha bisogno di tornare a credere nei grandi ideali della moda, MFGA si pone come potente strumento di propaganda culturale. Portare la bellezza della letteratura e del teatro nella moda è la grande sfida di questo brand che sovverte il linguaggio tipico della strada introducendo un modello di streetwear che attinge dal patrimonio culturale internazionale, rivisitandolo con la creatività e l’estro del design italiano, per ricordarci che cultura è un accessorio prezioso, anzi il più prezioso.\n",

EP Eco Planning - Future of Fashion has been working assiduously for the past year to bring back the hemp textile chain in Italy. The primary objective is to have, through the cultivation, processing and transformation of the vegetable, by extracting the fibre, a 100% Italian, 100% pure, 100% sustainable natural hemp yarn. This is an innovative and somewhat challenging project, not only to develop a yarn starting from the extraction of the natural fibre, but also enhancing the use of the waste that is generated after the first scutching phase: that is, the canapule. Cellulose-rich hemp (approximately 70%) could be used for the development and creation of an artificial, FSC-certified yarn: HEMP VISCOSE. We will be a company that takes care of its environment, its territory, upgrading it, a company that takes care of its customers by supporting them in making increasingly conscious choices in the purchase of yarn, giving them a valid alternative to classic natural vegetable fibres. EP Eco Planning - Future of Fashion is the only entity that, by aggregating a qualified network of experts and companies, will be able to provide two types of solutions regarding hemp yarn and its weaving. It will bring a traditional but at the same time innovative, totally Italian and sustainable product back into the limelight. We will be the only ones in the whole country to offer this complete service\n",

Traditional coloured lenses on bold frames, plastics in classic shapes. And then Eyepetizer. Steel, lightness. Delicate pastel coloured lenses and shapes of yesteryear. Here is the revolution of ultralight steel frames, in a classic silver, gold and gunmetal finish, and those two different end tips immediately redefine the codes of recognition and the uniqueness of the brand. \n",
      "\n",
      "THE TASTE OF LIFE IN COLOUR\n",
      "No-one thinks that it has been revolutionary, but everyone thinks that they would have liked to have done it. This is colour for Eyepetizer, the essence, the matrix that redefines priorities. The eye is plunged into always different nuances because for Eyepetizer sunglasses are not only about protecting from sun rays, but should also dress, decorate, and make the sight always new. The colours evolve depending on the season and the themes of the collection, but they represent the heart of the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE HISTORY OF EVERY COLLECTION\n",
      "It is known, revolutions never have a single face, they arise from a combination of intentions and attitudes. This is why packaging is never the same. Each collection has its history and a dedicated graphic created ad hoc to represent codes and quality to express inspiration and narrate its birth. They are born as stories of a life in colour in a continual flow of stories that evoke worlds. \n",

      "MISSION AND VISION: REVOLUTIONISE THE MARKET/ACCESSIBLE LUXURY\n",
      "Eyepetizer was born to revolutionise the market. In its approach there has been no caution and strategy, but passion and vision. The dream, real, by Eyepetizer, is the concept of accessible luxury. The quality of research and style with a masterly choice of material and ability for optimisation in the production phase, allowing delivery of a quality product at an absolutely democratic price.\n",

La moda è diventata un'icona del nostro paese, oggetto di desiderio e glamour internazionale, ma oggi lo sguardo sta cambiando e i valori che hanno prevalso fino a ieri stanno mutando verso concetti diversi come il design funzionale, l'innovazione e la sostenibilità. Il nostro obiettivo è dunque contribuire a creare una nuova realtà di mercato in cui tutte le persone possano sentirsi rappresentate. Ogni persona con disabilità dovrebbe avere la possibilità di scegliere quale marca di vestiti, scarpe o accessori indossare e di accedere liberamente ai negozi, alle merci e ai camerini di prova. Per ognuno di noi essere considerato un acquirente di valore è fondamentale all’ora di acquistare quel capo attraverso il quale racconteremo al mondo la nostra unicità e il nostro rapporto con l'ambiente. L'inclusione gioca un ruolo chiave in questo processo di cambiamento, tenendo conto non solo dell'importanza di abbattere le barriere architettoniche, ma soprattutto quelle mentali. Sollecitiamo anche una nuova forma di rappresentazione nelle campagne pubblicitarie e nei social media. \n",
